It was fun to share the week with fellow &ldquo;bean counters&rdquo; from across the nation.&nbsp; Our chapter worked hard to raise money for scholarships and we were rewarded by witnessing 5 aspiring accounting students not only receive a financial award but also learn from our &ldquo;pearls of wisdom&rdquo;.&nbsp; Our chapter is also about to embark on a financial literacy project where we can take what we know and share it with a group of people that would greatly benefit from our knowledge.&nbsp; I see now that by becoming more involved and attending the monthly meetings I have formed strong relationships with people that I look forward to seeing on a regular basis.&nbsp; It is great that the old image of the accounting profession of someone working with huge ledger books in a dimly light room all by themselves is truly a myth.&nbsp; Our profession is vibrant, energetic, technical, and most important of all, very social.&nbsp; Welcome to our social network!</p>\n" +
