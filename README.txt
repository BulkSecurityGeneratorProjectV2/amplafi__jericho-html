This is a fork of jericho-html.sourceforge.net

The fork was created to address some issues that we had with the original project that we needed in order to use it in a server environment:
 * Html errors are logged.
 * some issues with multithreading
 
The base code is pretty good in many respects.

Last merge with original project was 7 Mar 2011 ( 3.2 version )
